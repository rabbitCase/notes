- Often used to separate sections in the body of a document in order to style that content with CSS.
- `<div>` tags are commonly used when many elements are required to have the same format. Grouping such elements together in the same `<div>` tag enables a developer to easily style them by either using a class or an id.

When using a `<div>` tag, note that browsers will insert a line break before and after the element.
```
1. `<div>`
2. `This element has no particular semantic meaning but is often used in conjunction with CSS for styling purposes.`
3. `</div>`
```

```
1. `<div>`
2.   `<h1>This is a heading in a div element</h1>`
3.   `<p>This is some text in a div element.</p>`
4. `</div>`
```
